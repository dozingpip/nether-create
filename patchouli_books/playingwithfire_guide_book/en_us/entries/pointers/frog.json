Once you have a tadpole bucket though, the next problem is that tadpoles cannot survive in the nether's harsh environment long enough to grow up. Tadpoles can survive by being immersed in liquid chocolate, becoming a chocolate frog if you will. Once grown up, the frog can leave the liquid chocolate."
